Above shows almost the same timing for the mass assignment phase as the serial version.
The use of #pragma omp atomic can limit scalability if many threads try to update the same grid cell at once.

It suggests that the overhead of atomic updates and thread synchronization is dominant over the benefits of parallel execution with your current problem size and hardware
